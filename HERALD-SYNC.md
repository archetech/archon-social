# Herald Upstream Sync Tracker

This repo is a **thin overlay on Archon Herald**. The client and server code
were forked from:

- `apps/herald-client/` — React front-end
- `services/herald/server/` — Express/Node back-end

in the archon monorepo: https://github.com/archetech/archon

## How to sync from upstream

1. Clone the latest archon monorepo (or pull into an existing clone).
2. For each modified file listed below, run a 3-way merge:
   - BASE: the Herald version at the last sync (see "Last Sync" below)
   - OURS: the current file in this repo
   - THEIRS: the latest Herald version
3. Run `client` and `server` locally to confirm nothing broke.
4. Update the "Last Sync" line and the file list below.

## Last Sync

- Date: 2026-04-10
- Herald source commit: initial fork from `archetech/archon@main`

## Files modified from Herald upstream

Track every file that diverges from Herald here. Files NOT listed should be
byte-identical to upstream and can be replaced wholesale during sync.

### Client

- `client/package.json` — renamed to `@archon-social/client`, version reset to 0.1.0
- `client/src/App.tsx` — rewrote the unauthenticated `Home()` view to be a
  directory-first landing page with hero, stats strip, community grid, and
  modern footer. Added `HomeDirectoryEntry` interface. Public directory fetch
  moved into `Home` (previously only in `ViewMembers`). Removed the
  `if (!auth)` early return so the landing page renders immediately. Hide the
  large `<Header>` on the unauthenticated landing page.
- `client/index.html` — archon.social title, description, OG tags, theme color,
  llms.txt discovery link.
- `client/public/manifest.json` — archon.social branding, theme color #7c5cff.
- `client/public/robots.txt` — added reference to /llms.txt convention.
- `client/.env.production` — changed `VITE_API_URL` from
  `http://localhost:4222/names/api` (monorepo-via-Drawbridge) to `/api`
  (standalone nginx proxy). archon.social does not run behind Drawbridge.

### Server

- `server/package.json` — renamed to `@archon-social/server`, version reset to 0.1.0.
  Added explicit dependencies for `@didcid/cipher`, `@didcid/gatekeeper`, and
  `@didcid/keymaster` (these are resolved via workspaces in the monorepo but
  must be pulled from npm as a standalone package). Pin to the versions
  matching the Herald fork date.
- `server/src/index.ts` — added optional `ARCHON_HERALD_PUBLIC_URL` env var
  that overrides the default `${ARCHON_DRAWBRIDGE_PUBLIC_HOST}/names` derivation.
  Required for standalone deployments where Herald is not mounted behind
  Drawbridge under the `/names` prefix. Without this override, the challenge
  DID document's callback URL points at localhost:4222/names/api/login.
- Removed stale `server/.env.archon-social` (used old `NS_*` env vars).
- `server/sample.env` — added a standalone-deployment-oriented env template
  documenting every Herald variable the server reads.

### Added files (not in Herald)

- `HERALD-SYNC.md` — this file
- `README.md` — archon.social-specific readme
- `.gitignore` — repo-level ignore
- `client/public/llms.txt` — short AI visitor guide (Jeremy Howard llms.txt convention)
- `client/public/llms-full.txt` — full AI visitor guide with curl examples
- `client/public/agents.html` — human-readable agent onboarding page (standalone HTML)
- `nginx/archon-social.conf` — nginx reverse proxy config for the standalone
  deployment (serves client build, proxies API/OAuth/well-known/directory to
  Herald on 127.0.0.1:4230)
